# fake-job-recruitment-detection-using-machine-learning




This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to detect fake job postings by analyzing job descriptions and associated metadata. With the rise of online job portals, fraudulent job advertisements have become more common, often targeting job seekers to extract personal or financial information. This system aims to automatically classify whether a job posting is legitimate or fraudulent using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques.
